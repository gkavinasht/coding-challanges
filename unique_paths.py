# 62. Unique Paths
# There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.
# Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.
# The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10**9.

def uniquePaths(m, n):
    dp = [[1 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]

    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]

    return dp[m - 1][n - 1]

m = 3
n = 7
print(uniquePaths(m, n))

# Output: 28

# Time Complexity: O(m * n)
# Space Complexity: O(m * n)
